Wrapping Up
Objectives:
Test out our deployed server!
Highlight common errors

If you don't see any errors from the last step, drumroll...go to your URL! You are on the internet--amazing!!

Common errors and where to start debugging:
502, bad gateway: there is a problem in your code. Hint: any error starting with 5 indicates a server error
Your Gunicorn process wonâ€™t start: Check your .service file; typos and wrong file paths are common mistakes
Your NGINX restart fails: Check your NGINX file in the sites-available directory. Common problems include typos and forgetting to insert your project name where indicated.
Make sure the URL requested is correct (example if your root route is /home, make sure you put /home after the IP)
