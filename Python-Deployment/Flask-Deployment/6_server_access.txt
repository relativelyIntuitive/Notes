Step 4: Connecting to your remote server
Back in your terminal, cd to the folder that holds the key file you just downloaded.

> cd /projects/AWS

Now weâ€™re ready to use our .pem file to connect to the AWS instance! In your AWS console, click connect and use the supplied code in your terminal (PC users: use a bash terminal to do this).

Back in your AWS console click the connect button at the top of your screen here:

connect to instance button

A popup will appear with instructions on how to connect. The commands in red boxes are the ones you should run.

If you are a Mac user:

Run the chmod command in your terminal.

If you are a Windows user:

SSH is not built into windows. The easiest solution is to use Git Bash or another bash terminal. The other solution requires the installation of other 3rd-party software, an SSH client. If you wish to do so, we recommend PuTTY.

Everyone:

Copy and paste the line starting with ssh (below) and paste the text into your terminal.

ssh command pop up

You might have to type yes and wait for a few seconds or up to a minute before you are connected, but if all goes well, you should be on your Ubuntu cloud server. Your terminal should show something like this in the far left of your prompt:

ubuntu@54.162.31.253:~$ #Commands you write appear here
