Step 7: Nginx
Now, we just need to configure nginx to handle requests made by the server. Let's create a new file in sites-available.

sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{project}}
In this file, we will need the following:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name {{your public ip}};
    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/{{username}}/{{repo name}}/{{project}}.sock;
    }
}
Now, we need to link this nginx configuration to our sites-enabled directory.

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{project}} /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
Test nginx for errors:

sudo nginx -t
If we get a message saying that everything is (syntactically) ok, then we are almost done!
