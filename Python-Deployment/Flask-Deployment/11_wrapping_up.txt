Step 8: Wrapping Up
We will remove the Nginx default site display from directory sites-enabled, by running the following in your terminal.

sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
Now, all that is left to do is restart your Nginx server.

sudo service nginx restart
If your server restarted correctly, you will see the new command line, and your app is deployed! Go to the public domain and your app should be there.

If you see anything other than your app, review your server file for errors.

To exit the remote server, type:

exit
Common errors and how to find them:
502, bad gateway: there is a problem in your code. Hint: any error starting with 5 indicates a server error
Your Gunicorn process wonâ€™t start: Check your .service file; typos and wrong file paths are common mistakes
Your NGINX restart fails: Check your NGINX file in the sites-available directory. Common problems include typos and forgetting to insert your project name where indicated.
Make sure the URL requested is correct (example if your root route is /home, make sure you put /home after the IP)
