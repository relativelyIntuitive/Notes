"# Notes" 

Extensive personal notes directory backup, covering everything that I learned from the CodingDojo bootcamp. Everything is covered, from frameworks, to language syntax, to common algorithms and data-structures, as well as deployment instructions. 

Some notes are very brief, some are comprised of a great many scores of pages. Some subjects are covered in just one .txt file, others (particularly frameworks) are divided into seperate files. 

For help building an application from scratch, it is reccommended to start with the fullstack step-by-step guides and reference the notes for the individual tech as they come up if you are confused, as the organization is sometimes haphazard within the longer notes files, i.e. the React notes.

Feel free to take a look.
