"# Notes" 

Extensive personal notes directory backup, covering everything that I learned from the CodingDojo bootcamp. Everything is covered, from frameworks, to language syntax, to common algorithms and data-structures, as well as deployment instructions. Some notes are very brief, some are comprised of a great many scores of pages. Some subjects are covered in just one .txt file, others (particularly frameworks) are divided into seperate files. Feel free to take a look!
