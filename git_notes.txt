        FORKING/CLONING:
            1. Fork: Remote, server-side copy of a repository, distinct from the original.
                -Forking a repository that you don't own creates a copy of it on your GitHub profile
            2. Clone: Not a fork. A clone is a local copy of some remote repository.
                -You can clone a fork to get a copy of it on your local machine
                -   git clone [+URL of repository]
                    (clones repository to currently accessed directory)

        STAGING/COMMITTING/UPDATING:
            0. Check Status: Displays status of working directory and staging area
                -best to check before staging, committing, or UPDATING
                -   git status
                    (displays status)
            1. Staging: adds files to "staging area" 
                -staging area is a waiting room for files to be committed
                -   git add [+file name] 
                    (adds files to staging area)
                -   git add .
                    (adds all changed files to staging area)
            2. Commiting: every file in staging area will be updated with changes
                -creates another local-version of project, then clears staging area
                -   git commit -m 'some message here for commit name'
            3. Update the state
                -updates the repo that's tied to local copy
                -   git push origin master
